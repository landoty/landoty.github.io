### A Gentleman in Moscow - Amor Towles

I came across *A Gentleman in Moscow* through a Bill Gates review in 2019 and it has been sitting in my Amazon wish-list since. I stumbled upon it again when looking for a new book to take with me for spring break and it felt like the right time. 

*A Gentleman in Moscow* follows Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov, who, being deemed a threat and aristocrat by the Bolshevik's in 1922, is sentenced to a lifelong house arrest in Moscow's Metropol Hotel. Thusfar, the Count, as he is often referred to in the novel, is presented as a Rennaissance man of the time. Cuisine, music, literature, you name it. Whatever it may be, the Count is far from shy about sharing an anecdote before providing his opinion on the matter. However, almost with a deliberate dash of elegance, the reader can't help but appreciate and almost admire the Count and his uncanny charm.

I'm about 100 pages or so through the book and, while my progress has stagnated considerably (thanks, junior year CS), it's definitely a tough one to put down. Add the fact that *A Gentlemen in Moscow* follows the same time period and events as one of my all-time favorites, *Animal Farm* by George Orwell, I'm eager to find some time to pick it back up.
