I am an undergraduate student at the University of Kansas, studying computer science with an emphasis in security. I am set to complete my undergraduate studies in the Spring of 2024 while also beginning my graduate studies under the direction of Dr. Prasad Kulkarni. 

During my time at KU, I have discovered a passion for computer science as it relates to computer and systems security and have dedicated the majority of my young academic career pursuing these interests. Recently, I have found a specific interest in program anaylsis, software reverse engineering, and exploit development. 

I am passionate about applying these interests to the security of critical software systems including general computing platforms as well as mobile, embedded, and real-time systems. After completing my degrees at KU, I intend on pursuing post-graduate work in a research and development role.
