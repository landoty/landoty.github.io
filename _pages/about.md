I am an undergraduate student at the University of Kansas, studying computer science with an emphasis in security. I am set to complete my undergraduate studies in the Spring of 2024 and intend to pursue my Master's in Computer Science directly following.

During my time at KU, I have discovered a passion for computer science as it relates to computer and systems security and have dedicated the majority of my young academic career pursuing these interests. Recently, I have found a specific interest in program anaylsis, software reverse engineering, and exploit development. 

I am passionate about applying these interests to issues of cyber-physical, critical infrastructure, embedded, and real-time systems security. I have also found new excitement in machine learning as it relates to security and analysis.
