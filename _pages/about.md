I am a graduate student at the University of Kansas, studying computer science with an emphasis in systems security and programming languages. I am currently working on a project evaluating the effect of source language on binary analysis tools - particularly, BSim, a binary similarity tool included in the Ghidra SRE Framework. I am advised by [Dr. Prasad Kulkarni](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~kulkarni/) and am set to defend my Masters Thesis in the Spring of 2025!

During my time at KU, I have discovered a passion for both security and programming languages, so I tend to spend time thinking about how language constructs and compilers affect certain security properties. I particularly enjoy building better tools for RE/VR practicioners, applying concepts from the PL community. I also do a bit of reverse engineering work and recently earned my Offensive Security Exploit Developer (OSED) certification.

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaborating!
