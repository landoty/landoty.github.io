- title: Academic Interests
  type: list
  contents:
    - My current academic interests broadly include program analysis and reverse engineering including general computing systems as well as mobile and embedded platforms.
    - Recently, I have found great interests in binary analysis to facilitate software understanding when source language artifacts are not available.
    - I have been accepted into the Master's of Science in Computer Science program at the University of Kansas. My interests in these areas will continue in my thesis work, which will focus on the analysis of binaries produced by the Rust language.
