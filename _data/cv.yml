- title: Academic Interests
  type: list
  contents:
    - My current academic interests broadly include software and system security as it relates to cyber-physical systems and crtical infrastructure.
    - Recently, I have found great inspiration in the areas of program analysis and reverse engineering and have began individual studies in exploit development.
    - In addition, I believe the application of machine learning has just begun influencing the security community and will have significant application in the coming decades. As such, I have began exploring the fundamentals of machine learning to soon begin applying to my areas of interests.
